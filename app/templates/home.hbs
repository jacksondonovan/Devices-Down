      <h2>Our Mission</h2><br>
      <h4>Empower adults with research and knowledge of an ongoing and growing epidemic. By building a community, we can create and share our best advice for helping ween ourselves and our kids off of technology. Join our community of teachers, parents and even kids as we help build a better life and childhood for all.</h4><br>


      <p><strong>VISION:</strong>Devices Down is a dedicated to informing everyone on the potential harms of technological over-use. The average American uses their smartphone for 3 hours/day. Up from 2 hours in 2013. We're racing against the clock to build a community that is much needed in our society. Our vision is to help every child have a meaningful and impactful childhood.</p>

      <h4>Dinner</h4>
      <p>While many families tend to have a phoneless dinner table rule, it can often be broken.
      Many adults don't even realize when they are using their phones at the table.</p>

      <h4>School</h4>
      <p>Children as young as twelve are developing difficulties in and outside of the class room.
